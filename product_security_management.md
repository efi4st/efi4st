## product security management platform

This tool is intended to help manage security tasks related to embedded product development and its instances in the field.

Mapping Issues/Vulnerabilities for abstract systems&versions to Real-World Device Instances.
The primary goal is to bridge the gap between the abstract definitions of devices, systems, and software versions and the real-world, produced instances (device instances) operating in the field. This enables the following key functionalities:

1. Abstract Problem Management
   You can define a problem (issue) at a general level, such as for a specific device model or software version, without immediately associating it with individual devices. This approach allows a high-level view of potential issues that may impact your fleet.

2. Concrete Mapping
   By leveraging device instances, you can trace which specific produced and deployed devices (including details like serial numbers, provisioning status, and project assignment) are affected by a given issue. This ensures precise targeting and analysis of impacted units.

3. Practical Traceability
   The model facilitates backward traceability from individual devices in the field to their abstract definitions. This helps in understanding and analyzing the relationship between a specific device instance and its associated device models, systems, and software versions.

### Detailed Implementation of the Mapping
**Device Instances (sms_deviceInstance)**

This table establishes the link between a project and a specific device. Each instance has a unique serial number and other attributes, representing the physical, produced unit.

**Issues and Affected Devices (sms_issue and sms_issueAffectedDevice)**

1. Issues (sms_issue) are defined at the abstract level for a device model or software version.
2. Affected Devices (sms_issueAffectedDevice) maps issues to actual device instances, enabling identification of specific affected units, such as "Serial Number X in Project Y."

**Inheritance of Issue Data**

Through the hierarchy of abstract devices (e.g., sms_device) and their concrete instances, issues can cascade from an abstract level to the corresponding real-world devices.

### Example Use Case
**Abstract Level:**

An issue is logged for the device model "Router 3000 v2.1" in the sms_issue table.

**Mapping:**

The sms_device table reveals that this issue impacts all devices of this version.

**Concrete Level:**

Using sms_deviceInstance, you can pinpoint the specific devices affected by this issue, such as those with serial numbers A123, B456, and C789, which are identified as instances of "Router 3000 v2.1."

### Practical Applications

**Field Problem Analysis:** 
1. Identify all affected projects and device instances for a specific problem or security risk.
2. Version-Specific Insights: Analyze whether particular versions or configurations are more vulnerable.
3. Targeted Solutions: Apply feedback and mitigation strategies directly to impacted device instances, ensuring precise corrective actions.


## Database Structure Overview for a Modular Hierarchical System
This database structure models various entities and their relationships within a hierarchical and relational framework. Below is an overview of the core components and their interconnections:

### Core Entities and Their Roles
**Projects and Types (sms_project, sms_projecttype)**

   - Projects are linked to specific types (sms_projecttype).
   - Example: A project might represent a customer engagement, include dates, and reference data.
   
**Systems and System Types (sms_system, sms_systemtype)**

   - Systems belong to a particular type (e.g., Router, Firewall).
   - Systems may have certifications (sms_systemHasCertification) and include devices (sms_devicePartOfSystem).
   
**Devices and Device Types (sms_device, sms_devicetype)**

   - Devices are associated with a specific device type.
   - They may contain software, applications, or artifacts.
   
**Software, Software Types, and Components (sms_software, sms_softwaretype, sms_component)**

   - Software is categorized by type and may originate from third-party providers.
   - Components can belong to software or be part of applications.
   
**Certificates and Certifications (sms_certification)**

   - Systems may possess multiple certifications, ensuring compliance or capability.

### Hierarchies and Relationships
**Projects and Devices**

   - A project may encompass numerous device instances (sms_deviceInstance).
   - Each instance is linked to a specific device definition.
   
**Devices and Software/Artifacts**
   - Devices can include various software components (sms_softwarePartOfDevice) or artifacts (sms_artefactPartOfDevice). 

**Software and Components**

   - Software comprises multiple components (sms_componentPartOfSoftware), allowing for modular assembly.

### Specialized Relationships
   **Issues and Solutions (sms_issue, sms_solution)**

   - Devices and software may be associated with issues.
   - Solutions are linked to specific issues and are often tailored to particular device types.

**Release Notes and History**

   - Software and devices include release notes (sms_releasenote).
   - Updates are tracked via a history table (sms_updateHistory), ensuring traceability.

### Structural Summary
   The database is designed with modularity in mind, enabling independent and combined use of subsystems such as projects, systems, devices, and software. This setup allows you to:

1. Track certifications, version controls, issues, and solutions for any system or device.
2. Analyze relationships between abstract definitions (e.g., device types, software types) and real-world entities (e.g., device instances, software components).
3. Manage detailed histories and release information for better traceability.

This robust framework supports comprehensive management and analysis of all aspects of projects, systems, and their associated devices and software.
